This is a python project which will send you an alert message before it rains. So basically we use [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api) api to get forecast for the day and the code will detect if its gonna rain or not by using id present in the json file.
And i used [callmebot](https://www.callmebot.com) so that it can text you if its gonna rain. We can use [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) to automate it so that it runs the program at a particular time (which will be set by you) .
